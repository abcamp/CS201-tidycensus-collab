# CS201-tidycensus-collab

This repository is used as an exercise in GitHub collaboration in its most basic form!
This activity is inspired by one developed by Connor Flynn and Dr. Catherine Brockway.

We'll use tidycensus_intro.qmd as starting point for our collaborative activity.

In this activity, you’ll alternate: when the Owner is working, the Collaborator observes without touching their keyboard, then you’ll switch.

For collaboration:

1. Find a partner.
2. Decide who will be the "Owner" and who will be the "Collaborator."
3. The Owner will fork this repository and then invite the Collaborator.
4. The Owner will edit this README by adding their name below.
5. The Collaborator will go to their email, accept the invitation, visit the repository, and then edit the README by adding their name below.
    -  Owners: Refresh your page. Do you see the edit?


6. The Owner will create a new project in R Studio associated with this repository. How do things look? Commit & Push!
7. Now the Collaborator will create a new project in R Studio.
8. Both O & C open tidycensus_intro.qmd. Save a copy with "-yourname." NO OTHER EDITS.
9. Save, commit, and push!
10. Pull! Did you get a copy of your partner's file? How many total files do you have now?

Owner: Name 1

Collaborator: Name 2
